# boilrdata

This R package is a collection of biological datasets that have all been
compiled by researchers from the School of Biological Sciences at The
University of Queensland (Australia). These datasets come in various
formats and sizes and have been compiled to help teach data science and
programming using R. All datasets have associated, peer-reviewed
scientific publications that are referenced in the documentation. After
installation, you can call `library(help="boilrdata")` to see a list of
all datasets, and `?<DATASET>` to get see the documentation for a
specific dataset (e.g., `?nectarYeast`).

## Installation

To install the boilrdata package, you can run the following two lines of
code in R:
